## JSON Format

### Important Warning

**NEVER include `id` fields in your import JSON files!** 

Including `id` fields during import will cause the system to attempt to overwrite existing recipes or shopping lists with the same IDs, potentially leading to data loss.

### Recipe JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Chocolate Chip Cookies",
    "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.\n2. Mix ingredients...",
    "favorite": true,
    "categories": [
      "Dessert",
      "Baked Goods"
    ],
    "ingredients": [
      "2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour",
      "1 tsp baking soda",
      "1 tsp salt",
      "1 cup butter, softened",
      "3/4 cup sugar",
      "2 eggs",
      "2 cups chocolate chips"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Shopping List JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Weekly Groceries",
    "items": [
      {
        "item_text": "Milk",
        "checked": false
      },
      {
        "item_text": "Eggs",
        "checked": true
      },
      {
        "item_text": "Bread",
        "checked": false
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Two-tier architecture (Presentation Layer and Data Access Layer)
- Tkinter for the graphical user interface
- SQLite for data storage

### Database Schema
- recipes: Basic recipe information
- categories: Recipe categories
- recipe_categories: Many-to-many relationship between recipes and categories
- recipe_ingredients: Ingredients for each recipe
- shopping_lists: Shopping list metadata
- shopping_list_items: Items in shopping lists

### Class Structure
- RecipeDatabase: Handles all database operations
- RecipeApp: Manages the GUI and user interactions

## Future Enhancements

Planned future improvements include:
- Meal planning calendar
- Recipe import from websites
- Structured ingredient data (amount, unit, ingredient)
- Nutritional information calculation
- Mobile companion app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database Errors**: If you encounter database errors, try deleting the `recipe_system.db` file and restarting the application
- **GUI Problems**: Ensure you have Tkinter installed correctly
- **Import Errors**: Verify your JSON format is correct and remove any `id` fields

### Performance Tips
- For large recipe collections, use categories and search to find recipes quickly
- Generate shopping lists from fewer recipes at a time for better performance
